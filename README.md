# Asset-Risk-Metrics
A simple python code that generates the basic risk metrics for an asset and its benchmark.
When you run the code, it will ask you for the inputs (Asset ticker, Benchmark ticker, start date, end date and risk free rate)
The ticker symbols are based on yahoo finance tickers, make sure they are spelled correctly :)
